Note on multiple same-named branches (if they are still visible): the branches with "2" in their names are the most recent branches those respective team members are using. For the older branches, we encountered merge conflicts and the act of merging made those branches difficult to work with, so the numbered branches were created from older, stable commits from those older branches.
